=========================
ACCESS-NRI Model Live Diagnostics v0.0.1
=========================

**Framework for monitoring and diagnostic analyses of the ACCESS model suite.**

The ACCESS-NRI Model Live Diagnostics framework is designed to provide useful and practical Jupyter-based tools for the monitoring and diagnostic 
analyses of currently running (aka 'live') ACCESS climate models on the `Australian NCI supercomputer Gadi <https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems>`_.

The primary purpose of the ACCESS-NRI Model Live Diagnostics package is to provide a simple, easy to use and accessible framework for the 
ACCESS modelling community to check, monitor, visualise and evaluate model behaviour and progress on currently running or ‘live’ ACCESS 
models on Gadi. In addition to monitoring a live model, the package provides the functionality to load, 
visualise and compare legacy ACCESS model data with the selected live user model.

What does this package do?
=========================

This package is currently in active development within the Model Evaluation Team at the `Australian Earth System Symulator (ACCESS-NRI) <https://www.access-nri.org.au/>`_
so watch this space for version updates containing new features, model diagnostics tools and visualisation options! 

We value your feedback, especially in the form of reporting issues/bugs or suggesting ways to improve the framework. To do so, please open an 
`issue <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/MED-live-diagnostics/issues>`_.
